        <p>
            My previous experience in programming consits of studying C# and Java at beginner levels <br /><br /> Currently, however, I am studying: <br /><br /> Html
            <br /> Java
            <br /> C#

        </p>
        <p>
            And I plan to get to an industry standard in these languages.<br />

            I find that I have an active <a href="rainbow.html">imagination</a> <br />and I have no problem
            <express class="express">expressing </express> that in my work.
            <br /><br />I have good team skills from spending the last<br /> 8 years competing in a team. <br /> The team members came and left, and sometimes we weren't the best of friends, but we got the job done to the best of our ability.<br /><br />
             I pick things up very quickly. <br />An honourable mention is programming.<br /> Even now I am still learning new commands and enjoy implementing them into current projects.

        Previous experience
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although I have no professional workplace experience to speak of yet,<br />
        I do have my hobby (skydiving) which I have devoted over 13 years of
        my life to,<br /> and I am proud that it shows how determination and perceverance can reap incredible rewards.<br /><br />
        Skydiving has taken me around the globe,<br />
        let me meet many people and explore so many cultures.<br /><br />
        I won the Skydiving World Championships and the UK Nationals in 2016<br />
