<div class="main">
    <p>
        If my friends had to sum me up in one word, that word would be fun. <br /> They know me for my bubbly and easygoing personality, and I like to bring my friendliness to any groupwork I may be involved in.<br />I find I can diffuse any tention in
        the group with a whitty remark or pun.<br /><br /><br /> I compete as a professional skydiver as part of Volosity Freefly and The Dynamos. <br /> When I'm not competing, however, I love playing video games, or coming up with wacky and interesting
        ideas for new ones. <br /><br /><br /> One of my best skills is my problem solving. I love a challenge and embrace any opportunities I can get to show off new skills I have learned from solving various problems I have come across.<br /><br />
