Jamie Arnold - 16433770




this website has taken me about what feels like 20 hours to make,

this time includes the research and catching up on slideshows and HTML examples as i missed several lessons due to prior erangements and my alarm clock failing to wake me up


in my website, you will be able to see through all my commits that it has evolved from what i started out with,
from when i found i could changed the style of elements via hovering the mouse, or when my friend said my color scheme sucked and i should change it



what i think worked well:

i like how my website moves and is static, my honourable mention being the changing the color to red whenever you hover over something

i liked how the layout looked

the way the boxes expand on the index page

and of course the rainbows i included,


what i dont think worked well:

i dont like how difficult it was to get the layout how i wanted it, as it took me ages to figure out how aside worked, and i wish i listened more in class about that

i dont like how there is a line gap between "expressing that in my work" and "... and i have no problem" but for the life of me i could not figure out why :(



people i collabed with:

my girl friend told me things i can write on my bio, and oversaw the spelling for it





all in all though i like my website and i am proud to send it to people, and tell them i made it, i also love HTML code and after studying it throughout the holidays, i feel it comes rather
natrually to me and i wish to continue to learn more and create better websites (hopefully some java now <3), the bug fixing took me forever (about 3 hours in total) i had no clue
i could not name a div something like main4, or that i could not put a div in a p (as far as im aware), but all in all it was fun :)
